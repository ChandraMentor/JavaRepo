Examples for floating point representations.


Represent -2.625 in float (S)

Convert to base-2:
  -10.101
Put in floating point so that the integer part is 0 and
the first digit of the fractional part is 1:
  -0.10101 * 2^2
Determine sign field (0 for +, 1 for -):
  1
Determine exponent field (excess-128):
  2 + 128 = 130_base10 = 10000010_base2
Determine mantissa field (copy fract. part and pad with zeroes):
  10101000000000000000000
Result:
  11000001010101000000000000000000
Result in hexadecimal:
  C1540000


Represent -2.625 in IEEE 754 float
 
Convert to base-2:
  -10.101
Put in floating point so that the integer part is 1:
  -1.0101 * 2^1
Determine sign field (0 for +, 1 for -):
  1
Determine exponent field (excess-127):
  1 + 127 = 128_base10 = 10000000_base2
Determine mantissa field (copy fract. part and pad with zeroes):
  01010000000000000000000
Result:
  11000000001010000000000000000000
Result in hexadecimal:
  C0280000


Represent -2.625 in IEEE 754 double

Convert to base-2:
  -10.101
Put in floating point so that the integer part is 1:
  -1.0101 * 2^1
Determine sign field (0 for +, 1 for -):
  1
Determine exponent field (excess-1023):
  1 + 1023 = 1024_base10 = 10000000000_base2
Determine mantissa field (copy fract. part and pad with zeroes):
  01010000000000000000000
Result:
  11000000000001010000000000000000
  00000000000000000000000000000000
Result in hexadecimal:
  C005000000000000
