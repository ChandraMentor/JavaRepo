Abstract class

It is a combination of abstract methods and concrete methods.

1) An abstract class can contain any no of instance variables and methods.

2) An abstract class can contain a method with/without  method body.

3) A method without method body is also known as abstract method. A method with method body is known as concerete method. The same methods in c++ is called as pure virtual functions.

4) An abstract class can have 0 or any no of  abstact  method.

5) Java complier ensures that all the methods that are declared as abstracted are implemented in the concrete subclass of the abstract class.

6) A reference to abstract class type can be created and it can  be used to refer to any class in the inheritance chain as a normal class.

7) An abstract methods (methods without implementation)   can be  declared only in abstract classes.

Final class:
A class can be declared final so that no one can create a sub class of the class.

8) Since a sub class cannot be created for final classes an abstract class cannot be     declared as final class.
