Exception: An exception is an error condition that voilates the rule of Java program.

1) There are two kinds of exceptions in Java Language 
	a) Checked Exception and
	b) Un Checked Exception.

2) All checked exceptions are checked by the compiler at compile time.

3) Java compiler will not check for unchecked exceptions.These exceptions are also called as run time exceptions (These exceptions are detected at run time).

4) Runtime exceptions are considered as un recoverable and therefore we do not handle them directly.

To handle these exceptions java have 5 exception handlers. They are:
	1. try
	2. catch
	3. finally
	4. throw
	5. throws

try : It is a block of code used for testing validity of the statement.
	   try  {
	   //statement/s;
	  }
catch : It is a block that catches the exceptions generated by try block.
	 catch(Exception class ) {
	  statement/s;
	 }
Note :: Every try block must accompany catch block. A single try block can have any number of catch blocks based on different types of exceptions.

finally :: It is a block given after catch statement. It performs the clean up operation after the catch block catches the exception.
	finally
	{
	statement/s;
	}

throws clause ::  try and catch blocks are called as block level exceptions. Means that it works only for a specific block but where as
throws is a global exception. This exception is given after the method name.

eg :: public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {
            }
throws will not allow the method to continue where ever there is an  exception.
