To Learn about fragile base class problem which is there in c++.

Create sup.java with one method int m1() compile it.

create sub extends sup with one method m3() compile it.

creat an app using sub and run it.

Now add a method to sup and compile it and run the app without
compiling sub and app U will observer that there is no need
to recompile the sub class but this is not the case with c++
which using static binding.

We call this problem as fragile bvase class as a change in the base class breaks the existing sub classes (i.e requires a 
recompile / repairing).
