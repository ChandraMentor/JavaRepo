Properties of floating point numbers

1) A floating point no can take a positive infinity, positive infinity, Not a Number,
   + zero and - zero values.

2) Since 0/0 is an undefined value Java gives a result of Nan.

3) If any operation on floating point no's results in a very small no which cannot
   be represented by Float/double then Java give - inf as result.

4) If any operation on floating point no's results in a very big no which cannot
   be represented by Float/double then Java give + inf as result.

5) Adding two inf's of same sign results in same sign inf.

6) Adding two inf's of different signs results in NaN.

7) Subtracting two inf's of same sign results in NaN.

8) Subtracting two inf's of different sign results in infinity and sign will be same as
   left operand.

9) Any operation involving NaN results in NaN.

10) Overflow's results to Infinity of appropriate sign.

11) Underflow's results in zero.

12)  Adding / subtracting to and from either of inf's results in inf.

13) Multiplying inf by zero yeilds NaN.

14) Multiplying inf by some no  yeilds inf.
