examples on how callbacks can be implemented using interfaces

Please check classes9 for a similar kind of example.


We strongly recommend students to look into this example as this
the major technique used in most of the designs in order to enable the third 
party vendors to enable the creation of add on products.

the same kind of technique is used throughtthe design of many of the 
API's in java implementation and also in future the same will be used
in defining new api's.
