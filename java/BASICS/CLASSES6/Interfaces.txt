Interfaces
An Interface is a collection of method definitions which provides template for the creation of a new class.

1) An Interface declares one or more abstract  methods and it can        have  constants.

2) All the methods should be abstract in interface.

3) All methods in an interface are public.
 
4) None of the methods in Interface can be  Private,          protected,static,Synchoronized,Native.

5) All methods in interface are abstract whether or not marked as        abstract.

6) A class can implement (not extend) any number of  interfaces

7) A reference to interface can be declared by the class that has     inherited the interface.

8) An object of type Interface cannot be created.

9) A reference to Interface can refer to the object of class which           implements the interface.
 
10) An interface can implement another interface.

11) Interfaces forces the class to implement all the methods in the           classes that implement the interface.

12) All the fields in Interface are implicitly public and final.

13) A class that implement an Interface and does not provide an             implementation for some of the methods in Interface becomes          Abstract Class.

14) A class can extend and an other class and implement an interface simultaneously, which enables the feature of multiple inheritance in java.

Note:
Java does not support multiple inheritance by extending more than one class and provides a concept of multiple inheritance by extending a class and implementing an interface.
