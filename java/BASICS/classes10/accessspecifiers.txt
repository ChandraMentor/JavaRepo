1)Java has the following access modifiers

a)private
b)protected
c)default
d)public

Wider access is provided as we move down from private to public access specifiers.

2) Fields, methods or constructors declared private are strictly controlled,which means they provide no access outside their class.

3) Fields, methods and constructors declared protected in a superclass can  be accessed by subclasses.

4) Classes in the same package can also access protected fields, methods and constructors as well, even if they are not a subclass of the protected
 member's class.

5) Default access  is used when no access modifier is present. 
Java's package structure determines accessibility when default access 
is used. Any class, field, method or constructor that has no declared 
access modifier is accessible only by classes in the same package.

6)Public classes,fields, methods and constructors declared public 
within a public class are visible to any class in the Java program,
 whether these classes are in the same package or in another package. 

7) Private and protected modifiers are not used for classes

8) Private and protected modifiers are not used for interfaces or fields and methods within an interface.

9)The default modifier is not used for fields and methods within an interface.
