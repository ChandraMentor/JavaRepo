Package is a very convienent feature in Java that can be used to group related classes and interfaces together.

1)A package can be stored in a file system  or in a database.

2) Java classes that are defined without a package name will be stored in unnamed package.

3) The host system should provide atleast one unnamed package.

4) Most of the Systems associate one unnamed package for each of the directory that is searched by Java or only one unnamed package.

5)A package can have members of either or both of the following 
     a) Subpackages of the package 
     b) Types

6) Fully Qualified Names

Every package,class,interface and primitive type has a fully qualified name. 

a)The fully qualified name of a primitive type is the keyword for that primitive type.

b)The fully qualified name of a named package that is not a subpackage of a named package is its simple name.

c)The fully qualified name of a named package that is a subpackage of another named package consists of the fully qualified name of the containing package, followed by ".", followed by the simple (member) name of the subpackage. 

d)The fully qualified name of a class or interface that is declared in an unnamed package is the simple name of the class or interface. 

e)The fully qualified name of a class or interface that is declared in a named package consists of the fully qualified name of the package,
followed by ".", followed by the simple name of the class or interface.
