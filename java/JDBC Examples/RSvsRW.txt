Difference between JDBC 1.0 ResultSet and JDBC2.0 ResultSet

JDBC 1.0 ResultSet (JDK1.2X)
* One-time retrival
*Unidirectional fetch

JDBC 2.0 RS (JDK1.4)
*Bi-directional fetch
*Random selection of records
*Updatable (insert, update and delete)

Limitation
--------------
1) RS cannot survive without DB connection object
2) RS expensive for longer usage

JDBC 3.0 ResultSet objects are called as RowSet
1) Connection less ResultSet object
2) Serializable ResultSet object is RowSet
